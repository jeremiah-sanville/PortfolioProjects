# Jeremiah Sanville - Data Analytics Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Jeremiah Sanville. I'm an aspiring data analyst with a background of a bachelor's degree in psychology at the University of Southern Maine.
During my study, I found that I loved to work with the data we found and make visualizations. Coupled with my love of computers and past coding experience,
when I found the Google Data Analytics Certification, I was highly interested. I learned a plethora of tools including SQL, R, PowerBI and Tableau and developed skills such as data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I've been eager in learning new tools and refining my skills ever since.

This is a repository to showcase my skills and projects in the data analytics and data science field.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects and briefly describing the tools and skills used for analysis.

### COVID-19 Statistics
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project Queries.sql`](https://github.com/jeremiah-sanville/jeremiah-sanville/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project%20Queries.sql)                                                                                                
**Dashboard:** [`Tableau`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeremiah.sanville/viz/COVIDPortfolioProject_16748248126930/Dashboard1#1)   
**Description:** COVID-19 has been a globally pressing issue ever since it emerged in the past few years. This project aimed to use SQL to create a COVID-19 dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard is based on data that's updated daily in order to see the current outlook on the virus.                             
**Skills:** Data extraction, manipulation and visualization.                                                                  
**Technology:** SQL, Tableau, Excel                                                                
**Results:** A dashboard that accurately represents present day COVID-19 data with projections for the future.  

### Divvy Bikeshare Rider Differences
**Code & Report:** [`Kaggle Report`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/konoxians/divvy-annual-members-vs-casual-riders)    
**Description:** Bikesharing services are an emerging public service in many United States cities. It gives anyone on the street the ability to ride a bike for fun, travel, or a commute to work without having to invest and maintain a bike. These bikesharing services usually have two different options for payment: a membership or a one-time casual rate. My business task, as part of the marketing analyst team, is to find valuable insights and trends of how annual members and casual riders use Divvy differently.                                                                               
**Skills:** Data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, heatmapping, and visualization.  
**Technology:** R and various packages (tidyverse, validate, ggmap, data.table)                                                            
**Results:** Gathered multiple insights on how annual members and casual riders use Divvy differently. Recommendations to the marketing analyst team were presented targeting these differences. I also had recommendations for improved data collection to improve future analysis.
